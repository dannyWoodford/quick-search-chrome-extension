## install
  It wasn't worth deploying but if you want it on your local go to your chrome settings then find More Tools then Extensions inside that or put **chrome://extensions/** in your address bar.
Next, flip the **Developer mode** toggle in the top right corner. Next click on **Load Unpacked** and load files, assuming you've forked it already.
